# django-inventory-management-app
Software Engineering project. We were tasked with creating an inventory management web-based application.  
I was the backend engineer on the project. I was able to work with our database engineer to get a MySQL database integrated. 
Backend server using REST framework is functional and can successfully run CRUD operations. 
Unfortunately, we weren't able to get the front end-in a state that it could be integrated to the backend due to time constraints.
